<H1>This is why the viola rocks</H1>
<H2>Why I chose to play viola 
<H3>I am definetley not biased</H3>
<p>The viola is a stringed instrument that is very similar to a violin. It includes four strings, A, D, G, and C, with A having the highest picth and C having the lowest.
The viola has typically been viewed as a support instrument for harmonies, and who doesn't love some good supportive harmonies. I mean, we all need support and to work
in harmony, especially as technology professionals. Anyway, I chose the viola as my instrument in fifth grade and finally started to truly appreciate it my senior year of high 
school. It has a fantastic tone and by using third and fifth postion it is possible to play some of the high notes that a violin can. I have played for school functions and worship 
events. I enjoy playing the viola, although I often fail to practice the way that I should. The viola is like the middle child of an orchestra, but it still rocks!</p>
